== Neo4j Movies Example Application

This example application demonstrates how easy it is to get started with http://neo4j.com/developer[Neo4j] in Java.

It is a very simple web application that uses our Movie graph dataset to provide a search with listing, a detail view and a graph visualization.

THe front-end is just jQuery and d3 and the backend is implemented in Java using spark-java a lightweight web framework.

Using Neo4j from Java is as easy as using any other database that offers a textual query language.
With our binary protocol driver for the binary protocol, you get a clean API to manage your `Session`, `Transaction` and `Statement` and iterate over each `Value` of a `StatementResult` with a rich conversion DSL.

=== The Stack

These are the components of our min- Web Application:

* Application Type:         Java-Web Application
* Web framework:            http://www.sparkjava.com/[Spark-Java] (Micro-Webframework)
* Neo4j Database Connector: https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j-java-driver[Neo4j-Java-Driver] for Cypher http://neo4j.com/docs/developer-manual/current/#driver-manual-index[Docs]
* Database:                 Neo4j-Server
* Frontend:                 jquery, bootstrap, http://d3js.org/[d3.js]

=== Endpoints:

Get Movie

----
// JSON object for single movie with cast
curl http://localhost:8080/movie/The%20Matrix

// list of JSON objects for movie search results
curl http://localhost:8080/search?q=matrix

// JSON object for whole graph viz (nodes, links - arrays)
curl http://localhost:8080/graph
----

=== Setup

Spark is a micro-webframework to easily define routes for endpoints and provide their implementation.
In our case the implementation calls the `MovieService` which has one method per endpoint that returns Java collections
which are turned into JSON using the Google Gson library.

The `MovieService` uses the Neo4j-Java driver to execute queries via Neo4j binary protocol "Bolt".
You add the dependency to the Neo4j-Java-Driver driver in your `pom.xml`:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.neo4j.driver</groupId>
    <artifactId>neo4j-java-driver</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0-RC2</version>
</dependency>
----

To use the driver, you provide a connection URL, e.g. `bolt://user:password@localhost`, get a `Driver` instance, from which you get a Session.
The session allows you to execute Cypher statements directly and iterate over the `StatementResults` to access the resulting `Value`s.
Please edit example.movies.util.Util.java to add your connection settings, for instance "bolt://neo4j:neo4j@localhost"

With your statement you can provide parameters as a Java map.

[source,java]
----
Driver driver = GraphDatabase.driver("bolt://localhost");
String query = "MATCH (:Movie {title:{title}})<-[:ACTED_IN]-(a:Person) RETURN a.name as actor";

try (Session session = driver.session()) {

    StatementResult result = session.run(query, singletonMap("title", "The Matrix"));
    while (result.hasNext()) {
        System.out.println(result.next().get("actor"));
    }
}
----

=== Run locally:

Start your local Neo4j Server (http://neo4j.com/download[Download & Install]), open the http://localhost:7474[Neo4j Browser].
After logging in, install the Movies graph data set by entering the `:play movies` command, click the CREATE-statement, and hit the triangular "Run" button.

Start this application with:

[source,shell]
----
mvn compile exec:java
----

Go to http://localhost:8080

You can search for movies by title or and click on any entry.
